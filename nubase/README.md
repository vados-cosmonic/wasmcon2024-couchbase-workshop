# âœ¨ NuBase

This component implements a WebAssembly-native database called NuBase [Couchbase][couchbase].

The interface for this database is written in the [WebAssembly Interface Types ("WIT")][wit] (see [`nubase.wit`](../wit/nubase.wit)).

Importantly, the interface `import`s `wasmcloud:couchbase` for access to Couchbase, and exports [`wasi:http/incoming-handler`][wasi-http],
which enables providing an interface driven by HTTP.

**This implementation of this component is *incomplete***. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to complete the implementation for the database interface.

### ðŸ“š NuBase API

NuBase's API is simple, maximizing for developer UX, building on top of keyvalue provided by [Couchbase][couchbase]:

| API endpoint                   | Description                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `GET /api/v1/documents`        | Get all documents (paginated)           |
| `GET /api/v1/documents/:id`    | Get a single document                   |
| `PUT /api/v1/documents`        | Insert a single document                |
| `DELETE /api/v1/documents/:id` | Delete a single existing document       |
| `GET /api/v1/documents/latest` | Get the most recently inserted document |

While some of these endpoints are implemented, not all of them are -- that's where you come in!

## ðŸ‘Ÿ Quickstart

### Development

To develop this component, we can use [`wash dev`][wash-dev], a subcommand of the WAsmcloud SHell:

```bash
wash dev
```

> [!NOTE]
> Want to do things the hard way? Read [`./docs/build-the-hard-way.md`](./docs/build-the-hard-way.md)

After starting `wash dev`, you'll *automatically* have access to a [wasmCloud provider][wasmcloud-docs-provider] which
starts a local HTTP server that you can use to access your component.

Once `wash dev` has started, you should be able to simply `curl` your component:

```console
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/_status
```

[wash-dev]: https://wasmcloud.com/docs/cli/#wash-dev

### Build Build Build!

Once you're up and running with `wash dev` and can access the serveer, you can start implementing the
missing API functionality (marked by `// TODO`s) in `main.go`!
